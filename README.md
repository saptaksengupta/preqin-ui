# preqin-ui
A sample app built with simple react, ts, babel, webpack configurations. No pre defined tools like CRA etc is used.

# Quick Start

Go to root folder and then do: it will run out application on port  http://localhost:8080/ 
```
npm i 
npm start
```

Assuming backend is up and running by using the exiting docker Image, if not you need to install backend first to see frontend in action.

For backend installation:
```

```

To run test cases: 
```
npm test
```

Scope of Improvements: 
- More concrete test cases and test configuration can be done, Since I did not used CRA I had to setup test framwork from scratch and due to interest of time it requires more proper setup to run. 

- Good styling can be done
- State management library can be used (Context Api, Redux etc) to manage state. (Not necessary for small applications though!)
